= Introduction =

Learning algorithms for boolean functions have recently been applied and shown useful in various applications of formal verification, e.g., automated compositional reasoning and finding loop invariants.  
In this paper we present the tool BULL (Boolean fUnction Learning Library), the first publicly available implementation of such learning algorithms.
The tool is implemented in C with interfaces to JAVA and OCAML.
